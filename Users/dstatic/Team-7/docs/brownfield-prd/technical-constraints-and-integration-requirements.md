# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: TypeScript 5.x, Node.js 18.x
**Frameworks**: Express.js 4.18.x for RESTful API
**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with existing schema
**Testing**: Jest 29.x for unit testing
**Authentication**: Supabase Auth (fully functional)
**Package Management**: npm

### Integration Approach
**Database Integration Strategy**: Use existing Supabase client patterns, leverage established schema, ensure foreign key relationships work properly

**API Integration Strategy**: Follow existing Express.js routing patterns, use established middleware (auth.ts, validation.ts), maintain consistent error handling

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Design API responses for React Native consumption, maintain existing authentication flow, support mobile-first data structures

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Follow existing Jest patterns, create tests for new controllers and services, maintain test coverage for critical paths

### Code Organization and Standards
**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing controller → service → repository → model pattern, place new files alongside existing structure

**Naming Conventions**: Use existing TypeScript naming conventions, follow established API endpoint patterns (/api/resource), maintain existing variable naming

**Coding Standards**: Follow existing TypeScript patterns, use established error handling approaches, maintain existing response format consistency

**Documentation Standards**: Document new API endpoints in existing format, maintain inline code documentation, update README with new functionality

### Deployment and Operations
**Build Process Integration**: Use existing npm scripts and TypeScript compilation, maintain current development workflow

**Deployment Strategy**: Local development only (no production deployment required), use existing nodemon setup for development

**Monitoring and Logging**: Use existing console logging patterns, maintain current error logging approach

**Configuration Management**: Use existing .env pattern for configuration, maintain current Supabase client setup

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
**Technical Risks**: 
- Tight 7-day timeline requires focus on MVP features only
- Empty model files could break existing transaction functionality
- Complex database relationships need careful implementation

**Integration Risks**:
- New account system must not break existing transaction references
- Category implementation must handle existing uncategorized transactions
- Goal tracking requires transaction analysis without performance impact

**Deployment Risks**:
- No deployment complexity as this is local development only
- Testing must ensure existing functionality remains intact

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement Transaction.ts model first to stabilize existing functionality
- Create accounts system with default account for existing transactions
- Phase implementation to maintain working system at each step
- Focus on core functionality only, defer advanced analytics
