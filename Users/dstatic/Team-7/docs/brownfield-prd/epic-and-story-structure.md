# Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic to complete core functionality with rationale: Given the 7-day timeline and the fact that 80% of functionality is missing, treating this as one focused "Core Functionality Completion" epic ensures coordinated development and avoids dependency issues between incomplete systems.

## Epic 1: Core Financial Management System Completion

**Epic Goal**: Transform the 20% functional prototype into a complete MVP by implementing all missing core components (accounts, categories, goals, analytics) while maintaining existing authentication and transaction functionality, enabling young adults to comprehensively track their finances within a 7-day development timeline.

**Integration Requirements**: All new components must integrate seamlessly with existing Supabase authentication and maintain database consistency through proper foreign key relationships and transaction integrity.
