# User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI
New UI components will follow RESTful API patterns to enable frontend development. All new endpoints will support JSON responses suitable for React Native mobile app integration. Components will be designed to work with the existing authentication flow and maintain consistent data formats.

### Modified/New Screens and Views
- **Dashboard Screen** - Account summaries, recent transactions, goal progress
- **Accounts Management** - List, create, edit accounts with balance displays
- **Categories Management** - Manage transaction categories with visual indicators
- **Goals Tracking** - Create, monitor, and update financial goals
- **Enhanced Transaction Forms** - Account and category selection integration
- **Reports/Analytics** - Basic spending analysis by category and time period

### UI Consistency Requirements
- All new endpoints must return consistent JSON response formats
- Error responses must match existing authentication and transaction patterns
- API responses must include proper HTTP status codes and error messaging
- Data structures must support mobile-first design patterns
