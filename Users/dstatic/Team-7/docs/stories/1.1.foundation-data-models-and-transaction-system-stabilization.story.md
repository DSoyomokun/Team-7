# Story 1.1: Foundation Data Models and Transaction System Stabilization

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want to** implement all missing data models and fix the empty Transaction.ts file,
**so that** the application has a solid foundation for all financial operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Transaction.ts model is implemented with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. Account.ts model is created with balance calculation methods
3. Category.ts model is implemented with color and icon support
4. Goal.ts model is created with progress tracking capabilities
5. All models include proper validation and error handling
6. Models integrate properly with existing Supabase client patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Enhance Transaction.ts model (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Review current Transaction.ts implementation and identify gaps
  - [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces and validation
  - [ ] Ensure integration with Supabase client patterns
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Task 2: Create Account.ts model (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create Account interface with all required properties
  - [ ] Implement balance calculation methods
  - [ ] Add validation and error handling
  - [ ] Ensure proper TypeScript typing
- [ ] Task 3: Create Category.ts model (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create Category interface with color and icon support
  - [ ] Implement default category creation logic
  - [ ] Add validation for color and icon formats
  - [ ] Ensure proper TypeScript typing
- [ ] Task 4: Create Goal.ts model (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create Goal interface with progress tracking
  - [ ] Implement progress calculation methods
  - [ ] Add target date validation
  - [ ] Ensure proper TypeScript typing
- [ ] Task 5: Implement comprehensive validation and error handling (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add input validation for all model properties
  - [ ] Implement error handling for database operations
  - [ ] Add type checking and validation methods
  - [ ] Create consistent error message formats
- [ ] Task 6: Ensure Supabase integration patterns (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Review existing Supabase client usage patterns
  - [ ] Ensure all models follow established patterns
  - [ ] Test database operations with new models
  - [ ] Verify foreign key relationships work correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the epic, so no previous story context is available.

### Data Models
Based on the database schema analysis, the following models need to be implemented:

**Transaction Model** (Enhanced):
- Current implementation exists but needs validation and error handling
- Properties: id, user_id, account_id, category_id, amount, description, date, is_expense, created_at
- Source: [Source: backend/src/models/Transaction.ts]

**Account Model** (New):
- Properties: id, user_id, name, type, balance, plaid_item_id, created_at
- Must include balance calculation methods
- Source: [Source: backend/src/config/schema.sql#accounts-table]

**Category Model** (New):
- Properties: id, user_id, name, color, icon, is_default
- Must support color and icon validation
- Source: [Source: backend/src/config/schema.sql#categories-table]

**Goal Model** (New):
- Properties: id, user_id, name, target_amount, current_amount, target_date, is_completed, created_at
- Must include progress tracking capabilities
- Source: [Source: backend/src/config/schema.sql#goals-table]

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints are required for this story as it focuses on data model implementation. The models will be used by future stories for API implementation.

### Component Specifications
This story focuses on backend data models, not UI components.

### File Locations
Based on the project structure analysis:
- **Transaction.ts**: `backend/src/models/Transaction.ts` (enhance existing)
- **Account.ts**: `backend/src/models/Account.ts` (create new)
- **Category.ts**: `backend/src/models/Category.ts` (create new)
- **Goal.ts**: `backend/src/models/Goal.ts` (create new)

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all model validation methods
- Unit tests for balance calculation methods
- Unit tests for progress tracking methods
- Integration tests with Supabase client patterns
- Source: [Source: backend/src/__tests__/] (follow existing test patterns)

### Technical Constraints
- Must follow existing TypeScript patterns from User.ts and Transaction.ts
- Must integrate with Supabase client patterns
- Must maintain database schema compatibility
- Must include proper error handling and validation
- Source: [Source: backend/src/models/User.ts] (follow existing patterns)

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test file location: `backend/src/__tests__/`
- Test standards: Follow existing Jest patterns from auth.test.ts, expense.test.ts
- Testing frameworks: Jest with TypeScript support
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Unit tests for all model constructors and methods
  - Validation tests for all input parameters
  - Error handling tests for invalid data
  - Integration tests with Supabase client
