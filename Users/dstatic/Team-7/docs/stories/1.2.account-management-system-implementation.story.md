# Story 1.2: Account Management System Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** young adult user,
**I want to** create and manage multiple financial accounts (checking, savings, credit cards),
**so that** I can track my money across different sources and see accurate balances.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can create new accounts with name, type, and initial balance
2. Account list displays all user accounts with current balances
3. Users can edit account details and update balances manually
4. Users can delete accounts (with proper transaction handling)
5. Account balances automatically update when transactions are created
6. Default account is created for existing transactions to maintain data integrity

## Integration Verification
1. IV1: Account creation integrates with existing authentication system
2. IV2: Account balance calculations work with existing transaction data
3. IV3: Account deletion properly handles existing transaction references

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Design Account data model (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] Define Account interface/type in backend/src/models/Account.ts ([Source: backend/src/models/User.ts, PRD])
  - [x] Include properties: id, user_id, name, type, balance, created_at ([Source: PRD, backend/src/config/schema.sql#accounts-table])
  - [x] Add validation for account creation and updates ([Source: PRD])
- [x] Task 2: Implement Account CRUD operations (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Create endpoints for create, read, update, delete in backend/src/controllers/accountController.ts ([Source: PRD, backend/src/routes/])
  - [x] Ensure proper transaction handling on delete ([Source: PRD])
- [x] Task 3: Integrate Account with Transaction system (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Update transaction logic to recalculate account balances ([Source: PRD, backend/src/models/Transaction.ts])
  - [x] Ensure default account is created for existing transactions ([Source: PRD])
- [x] Task 4: Testing and validation (All ACs)
  - [x] Unit tests for account model and validation ([Source: backend/src/__tests__/])
  - [x] Integration tests for account endpoints ([Source: backend/src/__tests__/])
- Frontend implementation is out of scope for this story.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 is complete.

### Data Models
- Account model should follow TypeScript patterns from User.ts ([Source: backend/src/models/User.ts])
- Schema: id, user_id, name, type, balance, created_at ([Source: PRD, backend/src/config/schema.sql#accounts-table])
- Validation and error handling required ([Source: PRD])

### API Specifications
- RESTful endpoints for account CRUD ([Source: PRD, backend/src/routes/])
- Auth required for all account operations ([Source: PRD])

### Component Specifications
- Frontend implementation is out of scope for this story.

### File Locations
- backend/src/models/Account.ts
- backend/src/controllers/accountController.ts
- backend/src/routes/accounts.ts
- backend/src/__tests__/account.test.ts
- No frontend files are in scope for this story.

### Testing Requirements
- Unit and integration tests for backend ([Source: backend/src/__tests__/])

### Technical Constraints
- Must follow TypeScript and Supabase patterns ([Source: backend/src/models/User.ts, backend/src/lib/supabase.ts])
- Must maintain referential integrity with transactions ([Source: PRD])
- Error handling and validation required ([Source: PRD])
- Frontend is out of scope for this story.
