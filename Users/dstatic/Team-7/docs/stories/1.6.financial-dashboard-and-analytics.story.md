# Story 1.6: Financial Dashboard and Analytics

**Epic**: Core Financial Management System Completion  
**Story ID**: 1.6  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Assigned To**: Backend Developer  

## User Story

**As a young adult user,**  
I want to see a comprehensive dashboard with my account summaries, recent transactions, and goal progress,  
so that I can quickly understand my current financial status and make informed decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Backend Implementation (Current Focus)
1. **Dashboard Data Aggregation**
   - Dashboard displays summary of all account balances
   - Recent transactions are shown with account and category information
   - Goal progress is prominently displayed with visual indicators
   - Basic spending analytics show breakdown by category
   - Monthly spending trends are calculated and displayed
   - Dashboard loads efficiently with proper data aggregation

2. **Account Summary Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/dashboard/accounts` - Get account balance summaries
   - `GET /api/dashboard/transactions` - Get recent transactions with full details
   - `GET /api/dashboard/goals` - Get goal progress summaries
   - `GET /api/dashboard/analytics` - Get spending analytics and trends

3. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Monthly spending breakdown by category with percentages
   - Income vs expense analysis with visual indicators
   - Spending trends over time (weekly/monthly views)
   - Category-based spending limits and warnings (basic budgeting)
   - Export functionality for spending reports
   - Comparison tools for month-over-month analysis

4. **Performance & Data Integrity**
   - Dashboard data aggregation performs well with existing database
   - All dashboard components reflect real-time data accurately
   - Analytics calculations maintain consistency with transaction data
   - Proper caching and optimization for dashboard queries

5. **Integration Requirements**
   - Dashboard integrates with all existing systems (accounts, transactions, goals, categories)
   - Real-time data updates when transactions are modified
   - Proper error handling for missing or incomplete data

## Technical Requirements

### Data Models
```typescript
interface DashboardSummary {
  accounts: AccountSummary[];
  recentTransactions: TransactionWithDetails[];
  goals: GoalProgress[];
  analytics: SpendingAnalytics;
}

interface AccountSummary {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: string;
  balance: number;
  currency: string;
}

interface TransactionWithDetails {
  id: string;
  amount: number;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  description: string;
  category: CategoryInfo;
  account: AccountInfo;
  date: Date;
}

interface GoalProgress {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'savings' | 'debt';
  target_amount: number;
  current_amount: number;
  progress_percentage: number;
  days_remaining: number;
}

interface SpendingAnalytics {
  monthlyBreakdown: CategorySpending[];
  incomeVsExpense: IncomeExpenseRatio;
  trends: SpendingTrend[];
  budgetWarnings: BudgetWarning[];
}

interface CategorySpending {
  category_id: string;
  category_name: string;
  amount: number;
  percentage: number;
  color: string;
}

interface IncomeExpenseRatio {
  total_income: number;
  total_expenses: number;
  net_amount: number;
  ratio: number;
}

interface SpendingTrend {
  period: string;
  amount: number;
  change_percentage: number;
}

interface BudgetWarning {
  category_id: string;
  category_name: string;
  spent_amount: number;
  limit_amount: number;
  warning_level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

### API Endpoints
- **Dashboard Summary**: `GET /api/dashboard`
  - Response: Complete dashboard data (accounts, transactions, goals, analytics)

- **Account Summaries**: `GET /api/dashboard/accounts`
  - Response: Array of account summaries with balances

- **Recent Transactions**: `GET /api/dashboard/transactions?limit=10`
  - Query: limit (optional, default 10)
  - Response: Array of recent transactions with full details

- **Goal Progress**: `GET /api/dashboard/goals`
  - Response: Array of goal progress summaries

- **Spending Analytics**: `GET /api/dashboard/analytics?period=month`
  - Query: period (week/month/year, default month)
  - Response: Spending analytics and trends

- **Export Report**: `GET /api/dashboard/export?type=spending&period=month`
  - Query: type (spending/goals/accounts), period
  - Response: CSV/JSON export of dashboard data

### Database Queries
- Efficient aggregation queries for account balances
- Transaction summaries with category and account joins
- Goal progress calculations with transaction data
- Spending analytics with date range filtering
- Performance optimization for dashboard queries

## Definition of Done

- [x] Dashboard data aggregation endpoints are implemented
- [x] Account summary calculations are accurate and efficient
- [x] Recent transactions endpoint returns full transaction details
- [x] Goal progress calculations integrate with transaction data
- [x] Spending analytics provide accurate breakdowns and trends
- [x] Export functionality supports multiple report types
- [x] Unit tests cover all dashboard calculations
- [x] Integration tests verify dashboard data accuracy
- [x] Performance tests ensure dashboard loads efficiently
- [x] API documentation is updated
- [x] Code review is completed

## Notes

- This story focuses on backend implementation and data aggregation
- Frontend dashboard UI will be handled in a separate story
- Ensure efficient database queries to support real-time dashboard updates
- Analytics calculations must be accurate and consistent with transaction data
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed dashboard data

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1 (Foundation Data Models) - for basic model patterns
- Story 1.2 (Account Management) - for account balance calculations
- Story 1.3 (Transaction Categorization) - for category-based analytics
- Story 1.5 (Financial Goals) - for goal progress integration
- Existing transaction system for data aggregation

## Risk Assessment

- **Medium Risk**: Complex data aggregation and performance optimization
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and query optimization
- **Medium Risk**: Real-time data consistency across multiple systems
- **Mitigation**: Proper transaction handling and data validation
